# Open-Space
## This project is a simple web game where you have a rocket on a planet and a launch pad next to it. The launch pad is password protected. When the correct password is input, the buttons, sliders and the radio buttons get undisabled. In order to make the rocket launch into the air, all the options have to be on max and crossed out. Then the launch pad will be undisable and you can press it to see the rocket launching."
